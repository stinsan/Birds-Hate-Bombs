# Birds Hate Bombs

## What is this?
Birds Hate Bombs, or **BHB** as the cool birds call it, is an endless runner game made by me ([Justin Santos](https://stinsan.com/)) using Unity. It was my submission for the [Fall 2019 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ou-gda-fall-2019-game-jam) hosted by the University of Oklahoma's Game Developers Association; the theme for this Jam was "Two Buttons."

I continued working on this game even after the Jam ended, but here is the [original submission](https://stinsan.itch.io/birds-hate-bombs).
